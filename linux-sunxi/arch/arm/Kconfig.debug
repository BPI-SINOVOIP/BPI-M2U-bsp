config STRICT_DEVMEM
	bool "Filter access to /dev/mem"
	depends on MMU
	---help---
	  If this option is disabled, you allow userspace (root) access to all
	  of memory, including kernel and userspace memory. Accidental
	  access to this is obviously disastrous, but specific access can
	  be used by people debugging the kernel.

	  If this option is switched on, the /dev/mem file only allows
	  userspace access to memory mapped peripherals.

          If in doubt, say Y.

# RMK wants arm kernels compiled with frame pointers or stack unwinding.
# If you know what you are doing and are willing to live without stack
# traces, you can get a slightly smaller kernel by setting this option to
# n, but then RMK will have to kill you ;).
config FRAME_POINTER
	bool
	depends on !THUMB2_KERNEL
	default y if !ARM_UNWIND || FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER
	help
	  If you say N here, the resulting kernel will be slightly smaller and
	  faster. However, if neither FRAME_POINTER nor ARM_UNWIND are enabled,
	  when a problem occurs with the kernel, the information that is
	  reported is severely limited.

config ARM_UNWIND
	bool "Enable stack unwinding support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on AEABI
	default y
	help
	  This option enables stack unwinding support in the kernel
	  using the information automatically generated by the
	  compiler. The resulting kernel image is slightly bigger but
	  the performance is not affected. Currently, this feature
	  only works with EABI compilers. If unsure say Y.

config OLD_MCOUNT
	bool
	depends on FUNCTION_TRACER && FRAME_POINTER
	default y

config DEBUG_USER
	bool "Verbose user fault messages"
	help
	  When a user program crashes due to an exception, the kernel can
	  print a brief message explaining what the problem was. This is
	  sometimes helpful for debugging but serves no purpose on a
	  production system. Most people should say N here.

	  In addition, you need to pass user_debug=N on the kernel command
	  line to enable this feature.  N consists of the sum of:

	      1 - undefined instruction events
	      2 - system calls
	      4 - invalid data aborts
	      8 - SIGSEGV faults
	     16 - SIGBUS faults

config DEBUG_RODATA
	bool "Write protect kernel text section"
	default n
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && MMU
	---help---
	  Mark the kernel text section as write-protected in the pagetables,
	  in order to catch accidental (and incorrect) writes to such const
	  data. This will cause the size of the kernel, plus up to 4MB, to
	  be mapped as pages instead of sections, which will increase TLB
	  pressure.
	  If in doubt, say "N".

config DEBUG_RODATA_TEST
	bool "Testcase for the DEBUG_RODATA feature"
	depends on DEBUG_RODATA
	default n
	---help---
	  This option enables a testcase for the DEBUG_RODATA
	  feature.
	  If in doubt, say "N"

# These options are only for real kernel hackers who want to get their hands dirty.
config DEBUG_LL
	bool "Kernel low-level debugging functions (read help!)"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here to include definitions of printascii, printch, printhex
	  in the kernel.  This is helpful if you are debugging code that
	  executes before the console is initialized.

	  Note that selecting this option will limit the kernel to a single
	  UART definition, as specified below. Attempting to boot the kernel
	  image on a different platform *will not work*, so this option should
	  not be enabled for kernels that are intended to be portable.

	---help---
	  This option helps catch unintended modifications to loadable
	  kernel module's text and read-only data. It also prevents execution
	  of module data. Such protection may interfere with run-time code
	  patching and dynamic kernel tracing - and they might also protect
	  against certain classes of kernel exploits.
	  If in doubt, say "N".

menuconfig CORESIGHT
	bool "CoreSight Tracing Support"
	select ARM_AMBA
	help
	  This framework provides a kernel interface for the CoreSight debug
	  and trace drivers to register themselves with. It's intended to build
	  a topological view of the CoreSight components based on a DT
	  specification and configure the right serie of components when a
	  trace source gets enabled.

if CORESIGHT
config CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	bool "CoreSight Link and Sink drivers"
	help
	  This enables support for CoreSight link and sink drivers that are
	  responsible for transporting and collecting the trace data
	  respectively.  Link and sinks are dynamically aggregated with a trace
	  entity at run time to form a complete trace path.

config CORESIGHT_LINK_AND_SINK_TMC
	bool "Coresight generic TMC driver"
	depends on CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	help
	  This enables support for the Trace Memory Controller driver.  Depending
	  on its configuration the device can act as a link (embedded trace router
	  - ETR) or sink (embedded trace FIFO).  The driver complies with the
	  generic implementation of the component without special enhancement or
	  added features.

config CORESIGHT_SINK_TPIU
	bool "Coresight generic TPIU driver"
	depends on CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	help
	  This enables support for the Trace Port Interface Unit driver, responsible
	  for bridging the gap between the on-chip coresight components and a trace
	  port collection engine, typically connected to an external host for use
	  case capturing more traces than the on-board coresight memory can handle.

config CORESIGHT_SINK_ETBV10
	bool "Coresight ETBv1.0 driver"
	depends on CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	help
	  This enables support for the Embedded Trace Buffer version 1.0 driver
	  that complies with the generic implementation of the component without
	  special enhancement or added features.

config CORESIGHT_SOURCE_ETM3X
	bool "CoreSight Embedded Trace Macrocell 3.x driver"
	select CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	help
	  This driver provides support for processor ETM3.x and PTM1.x modules,
	  which allows tracing the instructions that a processor is executing
	  This is primarily useful for instruction level tracing.  Depending
	  the ETM version data tracing may also be available.
