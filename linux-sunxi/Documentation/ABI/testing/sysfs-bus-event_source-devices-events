Description:	Generic performance monitoring events

		A collection of performance monitoring events that may be
		supported by many/most CPUs. These events can be monitored
		using the 'perf(1)' tool.

		The contents of each file would look like:

			event=0xNNNN

		where 'N' is a hex digit and the number '0xNNNN' shows the
		"raw code" for the perf event identified by the file's
		"basename".

Description:	POWER-systems specific performance monitoring events

		A collection of performance monitoring events that may be
		supported by the POWER CPU. These events can be monitored
		using the 'perf(1)' tool.

		These events may not be supported by other CPUs.

		The contents of each file would look like:

			event=0xNNNN

		where 'N' is a hex digit and the number '0xNNNN' shows the
		"raw code" for the perf event identified by the file's
		"basename".

		Further, multiple terms like 'event=0xNNNN' can be specified
		and separated with comma. All available terms are defined in
		the /sys/bus/event_source/devices/<dev>/format file.
