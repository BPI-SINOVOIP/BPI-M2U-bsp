/*
 * Trace item
 * ==========
 *
 * A trace item contains a trace header, a timestamp, a UID and a
 * data header all of which are 32-bit and mandatory. If there
 * is no data then the data header size is set to 0.
 *
 * Trace header
 * ------------
 * 31   27   23   19   15   11   7    3
 * GGGG GGGG CCCC CCCC TTTT TTTT TTTT TTTT
 *
 * G = group
 *     Note:
 *     Group 0xff means the message is padding
 *
 * C = class
 * T = Token
 *
 * Data header
 *-----------
 * 31   27   23   19   15   11   7    3
 * SSSS SSSS SSSS SSSS TTTT CCCC CCCC CCCC
 *
 * S = data packet size
 * T = Type
 *		0000 - 8 bit
 *		0001 - 16 bit
 *		0010 - 32 bit
 *		0011 - 64 bit
 *
 * C = data item count
 *
 * Note: It might look strange having both the packet
 *       size and the data item count, but the idea
 *       is the you might have a "special" data type
 *       who's size might not be known by the post
 *       processing program and rather then fail
 *       processing the buffer after that point if we
 *       know the size we can just skip it and move to
 *       the next item.
